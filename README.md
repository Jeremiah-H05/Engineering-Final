# Engineering-Final
This game has two separate parts to it; a mine detection game and a roulette wheel. 
Players will select the difficulty the want at the start and then when they're ready, 
they'll hit both buttons to start. Then depening on their difficulty, they will play 
between 1 and 6 games testing where the bombs are. If they manage to avoid all the bombs, 
they'll get sent to the roulette wheel where they'll choose a color based on the extreme
light level they choose and if it lands on their color, the board will flash bright lights
and play a happy tune but if it doesn't, it'll play a sad tune and fade out red.
